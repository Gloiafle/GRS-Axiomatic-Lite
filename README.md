    # GRS-Axiomatic-Lite: The Gift
**Purpose:** Rapid deployment of biological health and energy abundance for localized Shards.

## Deployment Sequence
1. **Initialize Ledger:** Run `ledger_minimal.py` to create the local Shard database.
2. **Synchronize Energy:** Execute `monolith_driver.py` to begin ionospheric harvesting.
3. **Print Cure:** Use `lnp_config.json` to calibrate your Midnight Press R2R unit for PZR-Delta production.

## The Axiomatic Guarantee
This code ensures that once the "Seed and Key" are administered, the recipient is biologically and energetically independent of legacy centralized systems.

**Status:** In Silico / Phase 1 Deployment Ready
**License:** Axiomatic Open Source (AOS)

## System Overview
PZR is a programmable circular RNA (circRNA) therapeutic platform designed to permanently downregulate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. 

It utilizes a **"Seed & Key"** architecture:
1.  **The Seed (Payload):** A biologically inert circRNA vector delivered to hepatocytes.
2.  **The Key (Activator):** A small-molecule inducer that triggers the splicing mechanism to release the therapeutic protein.

## Core Mechanisms
* **Vector:** Circular RNA (circRNA) for high stability (t1/2 > 48h) and evasion of innate immune detection.
* **Logic Gate:** 3' UTR microRNA binding sites (miR-122) act as a "Tissue-Specific Lock," ensuring expression occurs *only* in the liver, preventing off-target effects in immune cells.
* **Delivery:** Zwitterionic Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) synthesized via Midnight Press R2R microfluidics.
